## So ... uh ... what is Azure Data Factory?  

- Before answering that _why use ADF_?
  - due to Variety, Velocity, and Volume of Data, Data Insights 
    are a necessity for keeping a competitive edge 
  - ADF is MS's main data engineering tool
    - _NOTE:_ Azure Durable Functions are worth exploring and understanding if interested in a Azure Functions based pipeline as well.
    
- ADF
  - PaaS Solution  
  - Data Integration Service  
  - Over 88 connectors for orchestration & automation  
  - Data Transformation  
  - Out of the box _codeless_ functionality for joining or otherwise aggregating data through the pipeline

- ETL/ELT: How does data flow through ADF / what side effects are applied to the data
  - ELT => Agility  
      - Developers can change queries on the fly  
      - Lends well for PoC or continuous optimization  
  - ETL => Reliability  
    - High degree that data will be well-structured and compliant
  - In ADF
    - Can do either ELT/ETL
    - Third party services to aid in translation/aggregation
